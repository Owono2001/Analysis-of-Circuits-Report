For the Analysis of Circuits lab report, the focus was on the analysis and verification of two-port networks using Z-parameters (impedance parameters) and Y-parameters (admittance parameters). The experiment involved measuring these parameters for both T-network and Ï€-network configurations. Theoretical values were compared against measured values obtained through the use of LTSpice software.

The objectives of the experiment included calculating and verifying the two-port network parameters using experimental data, understanding the significance of these parameters in network analysis, and demonstrating their practical application in circuit design. By analyzing both the theoretical and experimental results, I was able to confirm the accuracy of the calculations with minimal deviation between measured and theoretical values. The lab work provided insight into the practical applications of two-port networks in amplifiers, filters, and more complex circuits.
